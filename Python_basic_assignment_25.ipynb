    "#5) What is the relationship between map calls and list comprehensions? Make a comparison and contrast between the two.\n",
    "# Ans:\n",
    "# Map calls and list comprehensions are both techniques used in Python to apply a transformation or operation to each element of an iterable. \n",
    "# While they serve a similar purpose, there are differences in syntax and behavior. Let's compare and contrast map calls and list comprehensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Purpose:\n",
    "# Map: The map() function is used to apply a specified function to each element of an iterable and return an iterator that yields the transformed values.\n",
    "# List Comprehension: List comprehensions are used to create a new list by applying an expression or operation to each element of an iterable and collecting the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Syntax:\n",
    "# Map: The map() function takes two arguments: the function to apply and the iterable to operate on. It returns a map object, which is an iterator.\n",
    "# List Comprehension: List comprehensions have a concise syntax enclosed in square brackets. They consist of an expression, followed by a for loop and optionally one or more if conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Output:\n",
    "# Map: The map() function returns an iterator. To obtain the final result as a list, you need to explicitly convert it using the list() function.\n",
    "# List Comprehension: List comprehensions directly return a new list containing the transformed elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Functionality:\n",
    "# Map: The map() function is more flexible when it comes to applying complex functions or when you want to combine multiple iterables. \n",
    "# You can pass any callable object, including built-in functions, lambda functions, or user-defined functions.\n",
    "# List Comprehension: List comprehensions are more concise and expressive when you need to apply a simple expression or operation to each element. \n",
    "# They are not as suitable for handling multiple iterables or complex transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Readability and Expressiveness:\n",
    "# Map: Map calls can sometimes be less readable, especially when using lambda functions or complex functions. They may require additional lines of code to define and pass the function.\n",
    "# List Comprehension: List comprehensions are often considered more readable and expressive. They provide a concise and declarative way to express transformations on iterables."
